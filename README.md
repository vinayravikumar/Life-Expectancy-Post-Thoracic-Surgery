# Life-Expectancy-Post-Thoracic-Surgery
 This GitHub repository hosts a comprehensive comparative study on predicting life expectancy following thoracic surgery using three advanced machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, XG Boost, and Random Forest. The project aims to provide insights into the performance and accuracy of these models in the context of postoperative prognosis.
